* A custom devcontainer feature https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-starter (maybe my niceprompt example)
* terraform
* Ability to clone other repos into the workspace
* Build github actions for each container
* Setup my dotfiles in a remote container
* Sharing credentials https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container
* docker caching - to speed up build
* build a custom powershell jupyter build container
